# Face Recognition Task

This project includes the implementation of face recognition using OpenCV and machine learning techniques.

## Step 1: Capture and Save Images

- File: `capture_save_img_1.py`
- Description: This script captures facial images using a webcam and saves them in separate folders for each individual.

## Step 2: Split Images into Train and Test Sets

- File: `split_into_train_test_2.py`
- Description: This script splits the captured facial images into train and test sets and organizes them in separate folders.

## Step 3: Face Recognition Model Training and Evaluation

- File: `face_recognition_3.py`
- Description: This script contains the code for training and evaluating a face recognition model using a CNN classifier and an SVM classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and accuracy visualization.

## Step 4: Export and Use the Trained Model

- File: `export_use_model_4.py`
- Description: This script exports the trained face recognition models (CNN and SVM) and demonstrates their usage for face recognition in images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Run the scripts in the given order: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, and Step 4.
2. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.
3. Update file paths and settings as needed.
